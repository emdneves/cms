This is the case of the architecture of Michele Cannatà and Fátima Fernandes. But these two lines blend well. The result is a highly productive union between Portuguese constructive pragmatism and the theoretical power of Italian architecture, an interesting combination between critical regionalism and the typological bases of the tendency.

All this information allows for a complete understanding of each project and its contextualization through cross-references between the different houses featured in the book.\\n\\nIn the introduction, the author raises the idea of ​​the existence of an architectural canon for the single-family home, and offers a global overview of the evolution of this typology during the 20th century.", "Original price": 32, "publication date": "2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"}	2025-06-30 18:23:38.770202	2025-06-30 22:48:36.297907

His career is inextricably linked to the constructional technique of reinforced concrete: in works such as his 1903 apartment building in Rue Franklin, Paris, concrete - a material that previously had been perceived as common and industrial - was reinvented, handled artistically and granted its own idiom. Le Corbusier described this building as 'a foretaste of the modern world'.\\n\\nWith his projects in France and abroad - such as the Musée des Travaux Publics in Paris, the Church of Notre-Dame at Raincy and many other domestic, industrial and urban buildings - Perret caught the attention of a generation searching for a new architecture appropriate to the twentieth century. A committed constructor and innovator, Perret simultaneously adhered to structural classicist principles, continuously resisting the more transitory aspects of the avant-garde.\\n\\nThis monograph is the first sustained study of Perret in English, richly illustrated with new colour photography as well as drawings and photographs from the Perret archive. It also includes an appendix of Perret's aphorisms and other writings, which provide a penetrative insight into his craft and its artistic social priciples.", "Original price": 50, "publication date": "2001-10-18T00:00:00.000Z"}	2025-06-30 18:15:04.688473	2025-06-30 22:49:22.985757
